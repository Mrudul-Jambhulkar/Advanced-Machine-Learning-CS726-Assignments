# CS726: Advanced Machine Learning Assignments üöÄ

This repository contains my coursework for **CS726: Advanced Machine Learning** (Spring 2025, IIT Bombay), including assignments and a project on advanced ML topics like graphical models, diffusion models, and LLM decoding.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **Message_Passing_algo_a1**: Implements a Message Passing Algorithm for undirected graphical models in Python, computing the partition function using the Junction Tree Algorithm (triangulation, clique extraction, message passing).
- **DDPM_a2**: Implements unconditional and conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for image synthesis, with noise scheduling, classifier-free guidance, and evaluation metrics (NLL, EMD) on 2D/3D datasets.
- **LLMs_a3**: Explores LLM decoding for Hindi-to-English translation using Llama-2, implementing greedy, random, top-k, nucleus, and word-constrained decoding, evaluated with BLEU and ROUGE scores.
